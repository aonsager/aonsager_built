<p>My name is Alex. I grew up near Boulder, CO and spent most of my childhood reading books, playing music, and playing video games. I learned programming by making bad games for my TI-83 calculator. The first things I published online were bad flash websites.</p>

<p>In college I studied programming and human-computer interaction. A team of classmates and I made <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/These-Stanford-Students-Made-Millions-Taking-A-2361888.php">a few apps</a> on Facebook, which eventually turned into a startup. This was the first time I made something that was used by a large number of people. It became my introduction to making real products that have users and make money.</p>

<p>Since my day-job doesn’t currently involve much programming, I like to work on <a href="/projects/">fun projects</a> on the side that let me build things directly.</p>

<p>Part of the reason I maintain this blog is the hope that it will help me make more connections online. Please feel free to <a href="/contact">get in touch</a>! It would make me very happy.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h1 class="post-title">About my work</h1>

<p>In 2010 I started working for <a href="https://www.happyelements.co.jp/">a mobile game company</a> as the first employee in its new Japanese branch. At first I was in charge of localizing and publishing browser-based games to the Japanese market. Eventually we grew enough to start making our own games locally, and I transitioned to being a game designer.</p>

<p>Since 2022 I have been leading a department that is focused on making the company better at creating new games. This involves encouraging all staff to submit game ideas at any time, working with people to strengthen game ideas and create attractive game pitches, coaching teams through early development phases, maintaining a corporate strategy for the release of new games, and more. It allows me to work directly with a lot of people throughout the company, and has been even more rewarding than I could have expected.</p>

<p>I consider myself very fortunate that the products I’ve worked on have been used and enjoyed by so many people. In the future I want to continue creating things that have a large impact on people, and I hope to focus more on doing work that makes the world a better place.</p>
