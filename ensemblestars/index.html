<p><a href="https://stars.happyelements.co.jp">Ensemble Stars</a> is a project I worked on at Happy Elements. I was the lead game designer for the mobile app released in 2015, which featured virtual teen idols and released episodic stories about their lives on and off the stage. Over the years it grew into a multimedia project that produced novels, comics, music CDs, live concerts, holographic concerts, and an anime show. We started as a game studio and ended up doing work not far from being a talent agency for virtual idols.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="the-world-of-ensemble-stars">The World of Ensemble Stars</h2>

<p>The project takes place in a fictional world, focusing on a cast of more than 40 teen idols who attend an all-boys school for future stars. The characters are divided into a number of idol groups, with various themes ranging from hard rock to techno-pop to superheroes. Each of the students has deep character development and backstories, which are revealed in episodic stories released via the mobile game. The students are each voiced by professional voice actors who also perform as the characters in official music CDs.</p>

</p>

<p>It isn’t unusual for cartoon or virtual characters to have large fan followings in Japan, and fictional idols are no exception. Fans will buy CDs and attend concerts, performed either by prerecorded renderings of the characters or by the voice actors in person.</p>

<p>Starting as a mobile game was pretty unusual though, since in 2015 most game developers believed that the overwhelming majority of gamers were male. Games targeting a female audience at the time were almost entirely romance simulations, and Ensemble Stars broke the mold by using gameplay elements that were common in games dominated by male players. The risk paid off, and the project quickly gained enough of a following that it could expand into other mediums.</p>

<h2 id="the-game">The Game</h2>

<p>The core game cycle of the Ensemble Stars app involves collecting cards of the characters, leveling them up to increase their stats, and using the cards to participate in limited-type events. New events are released twice per month, and attaining a high score in these events will reward you with new cards exclusive to the event. Having stronger cards will make it easier to earn points, so it’s important to collect and train strong cards between events.</p>

<h3 id="micro-interactions">Micro-interactions</h3>

<p>An important aspect of the game is the idea that every interaction made in the game will make some progress towards having a stronger idol team. Being a mobile app, the game is designed to be played in very short windows of time, such as during a morning commute. Instead of having difficult stages or battles to complete, the game is about converting tiny units of interaction into progress that keeps accumulating over time. Even if players aren’t very skilled at games, or don’t have a lot of free time, playing the game casually over a long period will reflect significant progress.</p>

<p>The gameplay itself is extremely simple. Players can spend energy to accompany a team of students in their lessons to train their respective cards. Requests to perform in concerts will appear periodically, and after choosing the roster of participating idols you will receive points based on the collective strength of the idols and their cards. It’s honestly not too different from hypercasual clicker games that just involve clicking buttons repeatedly and getting points based on how many clicks you made. There is no difficulty curve or levels that need to be cleared, so nobody will reach a point where they can’t progress any more. Instead, the gameplay is focused on collecting new cards and stories.</p>

<h3 id="episodic-stories">Episodic Stories</h3>

<p>While most of the gameplay is centered on collecting and training cards, the main motivation comes from unlockable stories that are released periodically. The stories are written by a team of writers lead by <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%97%A5%E6%97%A5%E6%97%A5">日日日</a>, a prominent Japanese novelist, and show the characters’ daily lives as students as well as their efforts as professional idols. The stories focus strongly on the relationships between characters, and there is a huge volume of information about the students and their backstories. Most players of the app have one or several favorite characters, and each limited-time event features a new story arc with different characters given the spotlight each time.</p>

<p>The event-exclusive cards feature key scenes from these stories, and fans of the characters will be able to save these scenes to their card collections and recreate them in future concerts. While it’s not difficult to unlock and read all of the new stories, the strongest cards have the most attractive artwork and require significant effort to collect.</p>

<h2 id="music-cds">Music CDs</h2>

<p>Each idol group has released multiple music CDs, featuring the voice actors performing original songs as the game characters. There have been 3 series of CD singles and one series of compilations albums, for a total of 43 releases. Of these, 35 reached the top 10 in the Oricon daily sales rankings.</p>
