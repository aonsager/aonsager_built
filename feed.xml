<p>I created a thing that lets me save webpage contents in a smart way. I know, there are a million bookmark managers and web archivers out there, but this one is for me.</p>

<h2 id="the-motivation">The Motivation</h2>

<p>From <a href="https://pinboard.in/about/">Pinboard</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do you half-remember interesting things you saw online six months ago, but struggle to find them in a search engine?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, yes, a hundred times yes. This happens to me all the time. Searching my history doesn’t work because usually the keywords I remember are not in the title. Google et al. aren’t much help either.</p>

<p>I want a way to have the <em>contents</em> of the pages I visit be searchable, in a smart way.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="my-requirements">My Requirements</h2>

<h3 id="1-minimal-friction-to-saving-content">1. Minimal friction to saving content</h3>

<p>If I need to go through an entire workflow or remember some specific key combinations, I’m probably not going to use it. I want this to become a subconscious action whenever I finish reading something interesting.</p>

<p>Pinboard’s javascript bookmarklet is very good, but unfortunately I then need to manually add tags and a description. I mean, I don’t have to, but the bookmark is significantly less useful if I don’t.</p>

<p>I used the <a href="https://obsidian.md/clipper">Obsidian Web Clipper</a> for a while, and it was actually very good. The article text is saved in a new note, and tags and summaries are extracted from the page’s metadata <em>if they exist</em>. But, and I know this is a nitpick, it takes a few steps each time:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click the button</li>
  <li>Click “Add to Obsidian”</li>
  <li>Say “Yes I want to allow this site to to open Obsidian”</li>
  <li>Obsidian opens automatically with the new note</li>
  <li>Navigate back to the browser, to continue what I was doing</li>
</ol>

<p>Every time. It’s friction.</p>

<h3 id="2-easy-to-run-a-text-search-across-the-full-text">2. Easy to run a text search across the full text</h3>

<p>Titles and URLs are not enough. I want to expose the full article text to search, too.</p>

<p>Pinboard again, only allows me to search titles + manual summaries + bookmarks. I can pay $39 a year to enable full text search, but that’s kind of expensive and leads to the next point:</p>

<h3 id="3-not-expensive">3. Not expensive</h3>

<p>I mean, a couple of dollars a month isn’t <em>that</em> much. But they add up. This seems like the kind of problem that I, a non-power user, should be able to solve pretty cheaply.</p>

<p>Tangentially, I also really liked the idea behind Browser Parrot, which seems to have been replaced by <a href="https://github.com/iansinnott/browser-gopher">Browser Gopher</a>. It automatically saves every page from your browser history, and can extract the full text.<br />
The problem with this was that it ended up using <em>lots</em> of CPU, and the archive took up a lot of space, too. I think that in practice, 90% of the pages I visit are not worth saving.</p>

<h3 id="other-things-that-arent-needed-but-might-be-nice">Other things that aren’t needed but might be nice</h3>

<p>Some kind of tagging system (minimum friction of course) so that I can link related information and re-discover old items.</p>

<p>An accessible format to save the data. I prefer plain text to a database, because I can browse and open text files from Finder, or use them later for whatever I need.<br />
Would a database be more byte-efficient and make searching faster? Maybe. But since I’m not going to be saving millions of files, it probably will not make much of a difference.</p>

<h2 id="based-on-the-above-my-solution">Based on the Above, My Solution</h2>

<h3 id="1-put-any-webpage-i-want-to-save-into-a-special-bookmark-folder">1. Put any webpage I want to save into a special bookmark folder</h3>

<p>There are easy keystrokes and workflows that exist for creating new bookmarks. Bookmarks are automatically synced across my iDevices.</p>

<h3 id="2-run-a-script-that-periodically-looks-at-the-bookmark-folder-and-processes-new-items">2. Run a script that periodically looks at the bookmark folder and processes new items</h3>

<p>Setting a cron task to run this script once per day is fine. Bookmarks are saved as a plist file and can be parsed as normal XML. Items processed successfully are deleted from the folder.</p>

<h3 id="3-access-the-url-to-save-the-title-and-article-text">3. Access the URL to save the title and article text</h3>

<p>Python libraries can do this easily. There is a lot of optimization that could be done to check for errors and edge cases, but as a personal project I don’t need it to be bullet-proof. Just a simple grab and dump.</p>

<h3 id="4-use-chatgpt-to-generate-tags-and-a-short-summary-automatically">4. Use ChatGPT to generate tags and a short summary automatically</h3>

<p>This sort of thing is what AI was born to do. Having an automatic tagging system is such a luxury, and doing it directly through the API is dirt-cheap.</p>

<h3 id="5-package-into-a-text-file-and-output-to-a-local-folder">5. Package into a text file, and output to a local folder</h3>

<p>Now I have a single folder on my hard drive that holds all of the articles that I thought were worth reading.</p>

<h3 id="6-open-the-folder-as-an-obsidian-vault">6. Open the folder as an Obsidian Vault</h3>

<p>Searching the article contents is very fast, and I can use graph view to explore tags. I can probably do a lot to make it more useful, but for now it’s pretty.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.alexonsager.com/assets/images/2025/squirrel-graph.png" alt="Obsidian graph view. Black nodes are notes, green nodes are tags" class="center-image" /></p>

<p class="image-caption">Obsidian graph view. Black nodes are notes, green nodes are tags</p>

<h3 id="bonus">Bonus</h3>

<p>It also was super easy to set up an edge case for YouTube videos. Instead of grabbing the page body’s text, it instead uses the YouTube API to grab transcripts from the video. This is turning out to be a great way in general to extract information from YouTube and make it accessible to me later.</p>

<h2 id="the-script">The Script</h2>

<p>Is on <a href="https://github.com/aonsager/squirrel-archiver">Github</a></p>

<p>My intention is not to promote this for wide use, but you can feel free to fork it if you think it might work for you.</p>

<h3 id="my-archive-now">My archive now</h3>

<p>I went through the bookmarks I had saved in various places and ran them all through this script. After pruning dead links, I had about 500 articles saved over the course of 17 years. My most used tags are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Technology</li>
  <li>Innovation</li>
  <li>Design</li>
  <li>Sustainability</li>
  <li>Environment</li>
  <li>Development</li>
  <li>AI</li>
  <li>Community</li>
  <li>Creativity</li>
  <li>Javascript</li>
</ol>

<p>Sustainability and Environment were a surprise. I guess that when I read articles about those topics, I feel compelled to save them?</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="bookmarking" /><category term="saving" /><category term="automation" /><category term="searching" /><category term="content" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I created a thing that lets me save webpage contents in a smart way.

It began as a couple of html pages, and spent time as a Wordpress blog, a Tumblr page, and is now a static blog generated by Jekyll. Through that time, it had always just had my name, alexonsager.com. This year, I’m rebranding it to <strong>Invisible Parade</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="being-online-then">Being online then</h2>

<p>When I started this site I had just entered university, got my first MacBook, and was excited to become a full-fledged citizen of the internet. At the time, I thought it was cool to publish as much of yourself as possible. Tag yourself and your friends in the photos you take, scrobble the music you listen to, check in to the places you go, tweet your thoughts. Since I was broadcasting myself to the world, it made sense to put my name on my website. That’s how people would know me.</p>

<p>At the same time though, <a href="https://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a> was a cool site with the coolest name. <em>Daring Fireball</em> man, how do you top that?</p>

<p>Envious, I found a site that generates random adjective + noun combinations and hoped for inspiration. The second or third result I got was “invisible parade,” and I immediately loved the oxymoron. The whole point of a parade is to be seen by all of the people. What then, is the point of an invisible parade?</p>

<p>The name stuck in my head, and I think at one point I may have bought the .net. But I didn’t have anything to do with it, and eventually let it expire.</p>

<h2 id="being-online-now">Being online now</h2>

<p>It feels less in fashion to use your full name as a brand now. There is the risk of bad attention following you around, but also it’s just more useful to have a persona. There are literally a gazillion people online, so “hey I have a website” is not enough to make you interesting. You have to let people know people what you’re about, show some personality.</p>

<p>My real-name domain feels like showing up to a costume party with a name tag that just says “Hi, my name is Alex”. It doesn’t feel fun anymore!</p>

<h2 id="the-rebranding">The rebranding</h2>

<p>On a whim I looked up the invisibleparade domain, and it was available. It felt right, so I nabbed it, and here we are. And it is kind of a perfect name for the site.</p>

<p>I’m creating this parade of posts, if you will, and I’m putting in a real effort to make it interesting and nice to look at. But who’s even looking at it? What is the point of an invisible parade, or an invisible blog?</p>

<p>Well, it’s fun! I like putting it together. And if anybody happens to stumble across it, I’ll be happy to show it off. So here’s to another 20 years of parading.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="personal" /><category term="branding" /><category term="rebranding" /><category term="online" /><category term="nostalgia" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I first started this personal website just about 20 years ago.

Compared to Mastodon which required a fair amount of server overhead (more than I could justify for just playing around online), GoToSocial is very <a href="https://docs.gotosocial.org/en/latest/getting_started/#server-vps">lightweight</a>: 1 CPU, 1GB memory, and 15GB-20GB of storage space for the first year or so. Sold!</p>

<p>This would let me set up my own single-user server, which solves all of my misgivings about Mastodon.</p>

<div class="callout">
<div class="title">Disclaimer</div>
I am a total novice at all things server-related! I am probably at least a little bit wrong about some of the things I write here.<br />
Please take my experience with a grain of salt, and correct me if you can.
</div>

<p>I have a VPS with <a href="https://coolify.io">Coolify</a> to manage the multiple apps I have running, and all things considered it makes things very easy.<br />
I used a docker-compose file to deploy GoToSocial, and their <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial/main/example/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml">example file</a> was almost perfect as-is.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h1 id="port-settings">Port settings</h1>

<p>Coolify acts as a reverse proxy, so I used that part of the configuration:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">services</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="na">gotosocial</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="s">...</span>
    <span class="s">ports</span><span class="err">:</span>
      <span class="c1"># - "443:8080"</span>
      <span class="c1">## For letsencrypt:</span>
      <span class="c1">#- "80:80"</span>
      <span class="c1">## For reverse proxy setups:</span>
      <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">127.0.0.1:8002:8080"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>8002 was just an open port that I chose, and Coolify is smart enough to use that port to route traffic from my GoToSocial domain.</p>

<h1 id="file-permissions">File permissions</h1>

<p><a href="https://rknight.me/blog/installing-gotosocial-on-coolify/">Robb Knight’s blog post</a> showed me how to fix the sqlite database being unable to load because of a permissions issue. I had a similar issue with the Wazero compilation cache directory not being created, but I ended up just commenting that line out because it works without.</p>

<h1 id="shooting-myself-in-the-foot">Shooting myself in the foot</h1>

<p>I knew I had to mount a volume to make the database persist across redeploys and not be wiped fresh every time. <a href="https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/persistent-storage">Coolify’s documentation</a> made it very clear,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The base directory inside the container is /app.
So if you need to store your files under storage directory, you need to define /app/storage as the destination path.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, I changed the settings to make sure that things were stored under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/app</code></p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">services</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="na">gotosocial</span><span class="pi">:</span>
    <span class="s">...</span>
    <span class="s">environment</span><span class="err">:</span>
      <span class="s">...</span>
      <span class="s">GTS_DB_ADDRESS</span><span class="err">:</span> <span class="s">/app/storage/sqlite.db</span>
    <span class="s">volumes</span><span class="err">:</span>
      <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">~/gotosocial/data:/app/storage</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Which worked, except!<br />
I hadn’t realized that media storage also defaulted to the same (first) <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/gotosocial/storage</code> directory. Since this directory was no longer being bound, it was wiped clean after every redeploy.
Remote media was fine because it could be fetched again, but images I uploaded were lost.</p>

<p>I poked around in the terminal and saw that both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/app/storage</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/gotosocial/storage</code> were being created and used with no issues, so I just switched the database address back to the default <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/gotosocial/storage</code>… and everything worked as expected.</p>

<p>So, I don’t quite understand what the Coolify docs were trying to tell me.</p>

<h1 id="end">End</h1>

<p>Things seem to be working fine now, and I’m using mostly <a href="http://semaphore.social">Semaphore</a> to interact with the instance.<br />

<div class="callout">
<div class="title">Update 2024/12/27</div>
I have set up my own instance of GoToSocial, and have written about it <a href="/2024/12/27/installing-gotosocial-on-coolify.html">here</a>. 
This seems like the best solution for me.
</div>

<p>The main selling point of Mastodon is its <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/#federation">federation</a> I think, and I tend to agree with <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/11/15/Not-Bluesky">Tim Bray’s points</a> that some kind of decentralized, protocol-based network for social exchange is what will endure. Having one service run by one group of people is brittle. Having many services run by many groups of people is resilient.</p>

<p>People explain that Mastodon and the Fediverse are similar to email. You can make an account with any provider, and it lets you speak to anyone on a different service. You can have a Gmail account and still send emails to a Fastmail account.</p>

<p>But for me, the analogy is not apt, mainly because of server rules and moderation.</p>

<h2 id="moderation-of-mastodon">Moderation of Mastodon</h2>

<p>Each Mastodon server has its own set of rules and moderation guidelines. There are things you can’t say on certain servers, and servers can even blacklist other servers if they notice a strong trend of bad activity. Let’s be clear, I prefer keeping angry Nazis away. But it’s not the same as an email provider.</p>

<p>Imagine if Gmail didn’t allow you to send emails that made derogatory comments. Or emails that contained copyrighted images. Or if Fastmail stopped allowing you to send emails to Hotmail users because there was too much spam coming from it.</p>

<p>The point is not whether those are good or bad decisions, but that it <em>does</em> matter who you sign up with.</p>

<h2 id="who-do-i-want-moderating-my-experience">Who do I want moderating my experience?</h2>

<p>When comparing Bluesky to Mastodon, one point brought up often is that it is venture-backed. The service needs to generate money, and in the long run, for-profit services <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">will go to shit</a>. This is probably true.</p>

<p>Honestly, I’m OK with staying while it’s good and getting out when it gets bad. That’s what I’ve done with Facebook and Twitter and Instagram and whatever else. That’s life online.</p>

<p>The more pressing issue in the short term is who I want to be running the service I sign up for. The unpaid volunteers of a particular Mastodon instance who want to keep the service good because they care? Or paid employees of a publically scrutinized company who want to keep the service good for a strong salary?</p>

<p>Am I crazy to say that the latter feels more stable and reliable?</p>

<p>Passion projects fizzle out when the passion dies, but money keeps the wheels turning. Bluesky’s mission now is agreeable to me, so I’ll stay on their service and feel peace of mind. As the service strays from this ideal in the future, as it most likely will, I’ll look around for whatever better option is available then.</p>

<h2 id="the-actual-best-solution">The actual best solution</h2>

<p>If I want freedom and permanence together, the best solution is probably to run my own Mastodon server. And that does seem like the answer I’m looking for. I’m in control of my data and can do with it as I please. I can connect to other Mastodon instances and participate in the larger community. And while the small details may change, I can bet on a federated future that continues to let me maintain a node that plugs into a larger network.</p>

<p>The only problem, and it’s kind of a big one, is the price and the hassle. Setting up a Mastodon server is still kind of a lot of work, and the cost of upkeep is significant. I hope that entry costs will continue to go down because that is the future that I am most excited to see.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="mastodon" /><category term="federation" /><category term="moderation" /><category term="community" /><category term="bluesky" /><category term="social" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[But it’s just not doing it for me. Update 2024/12/27 I have set up my own instance of GoToSocial, and have written about it here. This seems like the best solution for me. The main selling point of Mastodon is its federation I think, and I tend to agree with Tim Bray’s points that some kind of decentralized, protocol-based network for social exchange is what will endure. Having one service run by one group of people is brittle. Having many services run by many groups of people is resilient. People explain that Mastodon and the Fediverse are similar to email.

Now they are back, made possible by <a href="https://github.com/souramoo/commentoplusplus">commento++</a>. <a href="https://commento.io">Commento</a> was popular and on my radar for a while, but the original repository has been dead for a while. Commento++ is a fork that has been dead for… a little bit less of a while. But it has a few improvements from the original, and as long as it’s stable I don’t care so much.</p>

<p>But the better question is not <em>how</em>, but <em>why have comments</em>? (Or why not to?)</p>

<p>I didn’t have comments for a long time, because I decided that this blog was a place where I didn’t care what other people said. It was a space for me to write and save things, just for myself. That’s fine, too.</p>

<p>But I’ve been thinking a lot about what it means for me to write on this blog, espeically in the context of generative AI getting so good at replacing mediocre writers. Paul Graham’s post <a href="https://paulgraham.com/writes.html">Writes and Write-Nots</a> resonated with me. The ability to write well is equivalent to the ability to think well. By continuing to write, on my own, I hope I can keep up my ability to think well.</p>

<p>And in many contexts, writing is also the ability to turn your thoughts into words and share them with other people. It is the ability to communicate. Writing in a personal journal might be good for my thinking, but I want to focus on my communication too. So, comments.</p>

<p>I’ll write articles on this blog with the intent of communciating my thoughts to my readers, few as they are. And since communication is a two-way street, I wanted some kind of commenting system to get feedback and discourse. So I hope you find my posts here engaging, and would be very happy if you left me a comment, too.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="comments" /><category term="writing" /><category term="communication" /><category term="blog" /><category term="discourse" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This site has gone through many forms, and comments have come and gone.
