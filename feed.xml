<p>Nothing much has changed for our family these past few years, and that is by design. Work is stable, life is stable, everybody is happy. I am very thankful for that.</p>

<h2 id="work">Work</h2>

<p>Since 2022 I have been leading a department that is tasked with making the company better at creating new games. This involves encouraging all staff to submit game ideas at any time, working with people to strengthen game ideas and create attractive pitches, coaching teams through early development phases, maintaining a corporate strategy for the release of new games, and more. It allows me to work directly with a lot of people throughout the company, and has been tremendously fun.</p>

<h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h2>

<p>In 2022 I joined a Haiku study group. We decide on a few prompts every month and submit our poems in advance of a meet-up, where we comment on each other’s pieces and have our teacher critique them. Haiku is fascinating because its extreme minimalism (only 17 characters allowed) makes it feel like putting together a puzzle. It is also a great way to learn about nature and Japanese culture.</p>

<p>Last year I set up <a href="https://gotosocial.org">GoToSocial</a> as a <a href="https://gts.invisibleparade.com">solo instance</a> to join the Fediverse, and that has been a lot of fun. It’s nice to be social on the internet again. I think this has helped motivate me to update this site more, and I’m having a lot of fun making little updates to the site as well.</p>

<p>AI tools have been super useful for programming as a hobby. It has made it so much easier to finish and ship my little <a href="/projects">projects</a>, and I have already developed a slew of little utilities that I use often. I’m still writing words by hand though, because I think being able to organize my thoughts into communicative sentences is such an important skill.</p>

<p>I also started keeping a physical journal at the beginning of this year, and one month is the longest I have ever kept up the habit so I am hopeful that it will continue. I had always admired people who keep physical journals; I thought it was a wonderful habit. I never could get into it though, and had resigned myself to thinking that I just wasn’t that kind of person. But my wife convinced me that if that is the kind of person I <em>want</em> to be, then it’s worth putting in the effort to make the change.<br />
So far, I am really enjoying it. I’m using the most simple interpretation of <a href="https://bulletjournal.com">Bullet Journal</a>. It’s turning to be a super helpful framework to guide the kinds of information I should keep, and the format for recording it.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="parenting" /><category term="preschool" /><category term="technology" /><category term="hobbies" /><category term="journaling" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Personal Life Nothing much has changed for our family these past few years, and that is by design.

They had taken lessons at various times and always sets aside time to practice because they enjoy it so much. They then recounted how they recently met their juggling teacher of ~10 years past, displayed their current juggling skills, and was met with astonishment at how <em>they had not improved one bit in all that time!</em></p>

<p>It was a funny story, but what struck me was just how <em>nice</em> it was that juggling was a constant source of enjoyment for this person <em>despite apparently being no good at it</em>. That’s a hard thing to do.</p>

<p>I think that the internet is partly to blame, since the entire world’s top talent is now at our fingertips. It is too easy to see the best of the best, compare ourselves to them, and end up thinking, “Well what is the point of <em>me</em> doing this at all, then?”</p>

<p>But we must allow ourselves to enjoy things, even in the face of our clear mediocrity. Is there anything I enjoy doing – and let myself enjoy – that I am not good at? Am I denying myself of any hobbies just because of a lack of skill? Let’s dig in.</p>

<h2 id="hobby-web-development">Hobby: Web development</h2>

<p>This one is tricky, because I used to be decent at it but am now well behind the curve. I can slap together some HTML + CSS + JavaScript and make an OK web page. I was adept at Ruby on Rails 10 years ago and can still fuddle through making a web app.</p>

<p>But I touched python for the first time last year. I used Docker for basically the first time last year. I have no idea how to fix a Linux server when things don’t go exactly according to Getting Started guides. I have never touched a JavaScript framework. I have a small comfort-zone and am totally lost outside of it.</p>

<p>These things don’t bother me though, because I enjoy the time I spend tinkering. Occasionally I decide I want to try something new, and I stumble and fumble my through it and maybe learn a little along the way. This is possibly the only creative activity that I can enjoy in a pure, <em>for the love of the craft</em> kind of way. I like that.</p>

<h2 id="not-yet-a-hobby-drawing">Not-yet-a-Hobby: Drawing</h2>

<p>Sometimes I get a hankering to draw a picture, and I always enjoy the time I spend doing it. But I am not a good artist. I’m especially terrible at drawing faces. Awful.</p>

<p>I can’t call it a hobby, since I rarely make time to draw. I have a suspicion that I would enjoy it if I let myself, and that the main thing holding me back is that I think I’m no good at it.</p>

<h2 id="hobby-haiku">Hobby: Haiku</h2>

<p>A few years ago I developed an interest in Haiku. The hyper-minimal structure makes it so that changing just one preposition, or modifying the word order a little, can have a huge impact on the poem’s overall meaning and impact. I think that’s fascinating.</p>

<p>I was lucky to find a group of people that meet regularly for Haiku. We decide on a few prompts, spend a month writing 3 Haiku each, and come together to comment on each other’s pieces and have our teacher critique us.</p>

<p>I think that I’m not <em>bad</em> at Haiku, but to be honest, I thought that I would’ve gotten a little better at it by now. This isn’t discouraging though, as I find myself not really caring how skillful I am. The exercise of distilling a scene to its barest core and painting its picture with my words is <em>fun</em>. I feel like there are some low-hanging fruits for improvement if I put more effort into study, but I’m pretty happy just puttering along at my own pace.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="actor" /><category term="juggling" /><category term="hobby" /><category term="creativity" /><category term="enjoyment" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A distinguished actor appeared on TV and talked about their love for juggling.

Aggressively optimistic, even. I made it through the first 1/3 of my life without feeling much stress, only getting angry on rare occasions. Anger management, emotional therapy, mindfulness exercises, these were all things that I had no need for.</p>

<p>I thought that this was a personality trait, but now I realize that I was simply blessed with an easy life. I wasn’t particularly good at dealing with stress, I just didn’t have much stress coming my way.</p>

<p>Well, parenting is not easy. It is demanding. uncontrollable, scary, and stressful. I love my kids dearly and would not want them to change for the world, and that seems to make it even harder. I want so badly to be the parent they deserve, to guide them with a gentle hand and encourage their every exploration.</p>

<p>But it is hard.</p>

<p>And I am feeling the stress that had nothing to do with me until now. I feel frustrated when things don’t go the way I expected, I feel ashamed when I neglect opportunities to engage my kids, and I feel angry when situations get out of my control.</p>

<p>I have to tell myself to take a deep breath and count to ten. I have to spend time with myself to sort out my feelings and learn what my needs are. All of these techniques that I had always overlooked as having nothing to do with me, are now suddenly instructive and eye-opening.</p>

<p>In my head, I know that I am probably overestimating the impact that I have on my children’s growth. They are their own people, and they will live their lives to their fullest. They will learn from and be influenced by so many more sources than just their father.</p>

<p>But I want to give them everything I can. I want to be a rock-solid, positive influence like my parents were for me. I want to teach them the names of flowers, and insects, and constellations, and construction trucks, and super-heroes, and inventors, and mountains, and countries, and exotic foods.

Aggressively optimistic, even. I made it through the first 1/3 of my life without feeling much stress, only getting angry on rare occasions. Anger management, emotional therapy, mindfulness exercises, these were all things that I had no need for. I thought that this was a personality trait, but now I realize that I was simply blessed with an easy life. I wasn’t particularly good at dealing with stress, I just didn’t have much stress coming my way. Well, parenting is not easy. It is demanding. uncontrollable, scary, and stressful. I love my kids dearly and would not want them to change for the world, and that seems to make it even harder. I want so badly to be the parent they deserve, to guide them with a gentle hand and encourage their every exploration. But it is hard. And I am feeling the stress that had nothing to do with me until now. I feel frustrated when things don’t go the way I expected, I feel ashamed when I neglect opportunities to engage my kids, and I feel angry when situations get out of my control. I have to tell myself to take a deep breath and count to ten. I have to spend time with myself to sort out my feelings and learn what my needs are. All of these techniques that I had always overlooked as having nothing to do with me, are now suddenly instructive and eye-opening. In my head, I know that I am probably overestimating the impact that I have on my children’s growth. They are their own people, and they will live their lives to their fullest. They will learn from and be influenced by so many more sources than just their father. But I want to give them everything I can. I want to be a rock-solid, positive influence like my parents were for me. I want to teach them the names of flowers, and insects, and constellations, and construction trucks, and super-heroes, and inventors, and mountains, and countries, and exotic foods. I want to make things with them so that they can understand how things work, how they can take things apart and put them back together again. I want to show them that they are special, and that they have so many unique things to offer to the world. But I am not that father yet. I’ve learned how selfish and impatient I can be. I’m new to this, too, so of course it will take a lot of time, effort, and patience. I need to take things one step at a time, and also let myself recognize that I am already doing a fine job.

<p>I created a thing that lets me save webpage contents in a smart way. I know, there are a million bookmark managers and web archivers out there, but this one is for me.</p>

<h2 id="the-motivation">The Motivation</h2>

<p>From <a href="https://pinboard.in/about/">Pinboard</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do you half-remember interesting things you saw online six months ago, but struggle to find them in a search engine?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, yes, a hundred times yes. This happens to me all the time. Searching my history doesn’t work because usually the keywords I remember are not in the title. Google et al. aren’t much help either.</p>

<p>I want a way to have the <em>contents</em> of the pages I visit be searchable, in a smart way.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="my-requirements">My Requirements</h2>

<h3 id="1-minimal-friction-to-saving-content">1. Minimal friction to saving content</h3>

<p>If I need to go through an entire workflow or remember some specific key combinations, I’m probably not going to use it. I want this to become a subconscious action whenever I finish reading something interesting.</p>

<p>Pinboard’s javascript bookmarklet is very good, but unfortunately I then need to manually add tags and a description. I mean, I don’t have to, but the bookmark is significantly less useful if I don’t.</p>

<p>I used the <a href="https://obsidian.md/clipper">Obsidian Web Clipper</a> for a while, and it was actually very good. The article text is saved in a new note, and tags and summaries are extracted from the page’s metadata <em>if they exist</em>. But, and I know this is a nitpick, it takes a few steps each time:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click the button</li>
  <li>Click “Add to Obsidian”</li>
  <li>Say “Yes I want to allow this site to to open Obsidian”</li>
  <li>Obsidian opens automatically with the new note</li>
  <li>Navigate back to the browser, to continue what I was doing</li>
</ol>

<p>Every time. It’s friction.</p>

<h3 id="2-easy-to-run-a-text-search-across-the-full-text">2. Easy to run a text search across the full text</h3>

<p>Titles and URLs are not enough. I want to expose the full article text to search, too.</p>

<p>Pinboard again, only allows me to search titles + manual summaries + bookmarks. I can pay $39 a year to enable full text search, but that’s kind of expensive and leads to the next point:</p>

<h3 id="3-not-expensive">3. Not expensive</h3>

<p>I mean, a couple of dollars a month isn’t <em>that</em> much. But they add up. This seems like the kind of problem that I, a non-power user, should be able to solve pretty cheaply.</p>

<p>Tangentially, I also really liked the idea behind Browser Parrot, which seems to have been replaced by <a href="https://github.com/iansinnott/browser-gopher">Browser Gopher</a>. It automatically saves every page from your browser history, and can extract the full text.<br />
The problem with this was that it ended up using <em>lots</em> of CPU, and the archive took up a lot of space, too. I think that in practice, 90% of the pages I visit are not worth saving.</p>

<h3 id="other-things-that-arent-needed-but-might-be-nice">Other things that aren’t needed but might be nice</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Some kind of tagging system (minimum friction of course) so that I can link related information and re-discover old items.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An accessible format to save the data. I prefer plain text to a database, because I can browse and open text files from Finder, or use them later for whatever I need.<br />
Would a database be more byte-efficient and make searching faster? Maybe. But since I’m not going to be saving millions of files, it probably will not make much of a difference.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="based-on-the-above-my-solution">Based on the above, my solution</h2>

<h3 id="1-put-any-webpage-i-want-to-save-into-a-text-file">1. Put any webpage I want to save into a text file</h3>

<div class="callout">
<div class="title">Update 2025/02/14</div>
I wanted to use a folder in Safari bookmarks to save URLs since the OS already has handy hotkeys and utilities, but unfortunately editing the plist file by hand caused sync issues, so I gave up.
</div>

<p>I set up a Shortcut to grab Safari’s URL and add it to a text file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">urls.txt</code>, which lives on my iCloud drive.</p>

<h3 id="2-run-a-script-that-periodically-looks-at-urlstxt-and-processes-new-items">2. Run a script that periodically looks at urls.txt and processes new items</h3>

<p>Setting a cron task to run this script once per day is fine. The text file is wiped after each run, and URLs that failed for some reason are saved to a separate file.</p>

<h3 id="3-access-the-url-to-save-the-title-and-article-text">3. Access the URL to save the title and article text</h3>

<p>Python libraries can do this easily. There is a lot of optimization that could be done to check for errors and edge cases, but as a personal project I don’t need it to be bullet-proof. Just a simple grab and dump.</p>

<h3 id="4-use-chatgpt-to-generate-tags-and-a-short-summary-automatically">4. Use ChatGPT to generate tags and a short summary automatically</h3>

<p>This sort of thing is what AI was born to do. Having an automatic tagging system is such a luxury, and doing it directly through the API is dirt-cheap.</p>

<h3 id="5-package-into-a-text-file-and-output-to-a-local-folder">5. Package into a text file, and output to a local folder</h3>

<p>Now I have a single folder on my hard drive that holds all of the articles that I thought were worth reading.</p>

<h3 id="6-open-the-folder-as-an-obsidian-vault">6. Open the folder as an Obsidian Vault</h3>

<p>Searching the article contents is very fast, and I can use graph view to explore tags. I can probably do a lot to make it more useful, but for now it’s pretty.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://invisibleparade.com/assets/images/2025/squirrel-graph.png" alt="Obsidian graph view. Black nodes are notes, green nodes are tags" class="center-image" />
  <figcaption>Obsidian graph view. Black nodes are notes, green nodes are tags</figcaption>
  </figure>

<h3 id="bonus">Bonus</h3>

<p>It also was super easy to set up an edge case for YouTube videos. Instead of grabbing the page body’s text, it instead uses the YouTube API to grab transcripts from the video. This is turning out to be a great way in general to extract information from YouTube and make it accessible to me later.</p>

<h2 id="the-script">The Script</h2>

<p>Is on <a href="https://github.com/aonsager/squirrel-archiver">Github</a></p>

<p>My intention is not to promote this for wide use, but you can feel free to fork it if you think it might work for you.</p>

<h3 id="my-archive-now">My archive now</h3>

<p>I went through the bookmarks I had saved in various places and ran them all through this script. After pruning dead links, I had about 500 articles saved over the course of 17 years. My most used tags are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Technology</li>
  <li>Innovation</li>
  <li>Design</li>
  <li>Sustainability</li>
  <li>Environment</li>
  <li>Development</li>
  <li>AI</li>
  <li>Community</li>
  <li>Creativity</li>
  <li>Javascript</li>
</ol>

<p>Sustainability and Environment were a surprise. I guess that when I read articles about those topics, I feel compelled to save them?</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="bookmarking" /><category term="saving" /><category term="automation" /><category term="searching" /><category term="content" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I created a thing that lets me save webpage contents in a smart way.

It began as a couple of html pages, and spent time as a Wordpress blog, a Tumblr page, and is now a static blog generated by Jekyll. Through that time, it had always just had my name, alexonsager.com. This year, I’m rebranding it to <strong>Invisible Parade</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="being-online-then">Being online then</h2>

<p>When I started this site I had just entered university, got my first MacBook, and was excited to become a full-fledged citizen of the internet. At the time, I thought it was cool to publish as much of yourself as possible. Tag yourself and your friends in the photos you take, scrobble the music you listen to, check in to the places you go, tweet your thoughts. Since I was broadcasting myself to the world, it made sense to put my name on my website. That’s how people would know me.</p>

<p>At the same time though, <a href="https://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a> was a cool site with the coolest name. <em>Daring Fireball</em> man, how do you top that?</p>

<p>Envious, I found a site that generates random adjective + noun combinations and hoped for inspiration. The second or third result I got was “invisible parade,” and I immediately loved the oxymoron. The whole point of a parade is to be seen by all of the people. What then, is the point of an invisible parade?</p>

<p>The name stuck in my head, and I think at one point I may have bought the .net. But I didn’t have anything to do with it, and eventually let it expire.</p>

<h2 id="being-online-now">Being online now</h2>

<p>It feels less in fashion to use your full name as a brand now. There is the risk of bad attention following you around, but also it’s just more useful to have a persona. There are literally a gazillion people online, so “hey I have a website” is not enough to make you interesting. You have to let people know people what you’re about, show some personality.</p>

<p>My real-name domain feels like showing up to a costume party with a name tag that just says “Hi, my name is Alex”. It doesn’t feel fun anymore!</p>

<h2 id="the-rebranding">The rebranding</h2>

<p>On a whim I looked up the invisibleparade domain, and it was available. It felt right, so I nabbed it, and here we are. And it is kind of a perfect name for the site.</p>

<p>I’m creating this parade of posts, if you will, and I’m putting in a real effort to make it interesting and nice to look at. But who’s even looking at it? What is the point of an invisible parade, or an invisible blog?</p>

<p>Well, it’s fun! I like putting it together. And if anybody happens to stumble across it, I’ll be happy to show it off. So here’s to another 20 years of parading.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="personal" /><category term="branding" /><category term="rebranding" /><category term="online" /><category term="nostalgia" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I first started this personal website just about 20 years ago.
