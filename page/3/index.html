            <p>A long time ago, I fancied myself a writer and strove to write beautiful prose. I read a lot and borrowed from styles that I admired, but oftentimes my sentences ran on, and I relied on my thesaurus too heavily. But I enjoyed the process of writing and reached a familiarity with words that allowed me to simply let my thoughts flow through my fingers onto the page.</p>

<p>At university, I discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style">The Elements of Style</a> and quickly became an advocate instead of lean, effective prose. I strove to convey my thoughts using fewer words. Composition took more effort as I scrutinized each phrase. I was happy with the results, and I felt a deliberate craftsmanship that seemed more pronounced than before.</p>

<p>Then, I moved to Asia and began communicating primarily with people for whom English wasn’t their first language. I started using short, simple sentences that got straight to the point. If the purpose of writing is communication, then all that’s really important is to tell the other person what they need to know, right? Saying things in a fancy way will only complicate things.</p>

<p>It was around this time that I first saw the <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Simple English Wikipedia</a>, and my first thought was, “Now this is the pinnacle of knowledge transfer. This is how you provide the most information to the most number of people as efficiently as possible.”</p>

<p>“But,” nagged a deep and quiet part of my mind, “that can’t be the full story. Poetry and literature, sure, it’s easy to set those aside and say maybe that it’s an art form, it’s writing for the sake of writing, and that’s why the pursuit of beauty can occur. Normal, day-to-day writing is not the same.</p>

<p>“What about, say, Journalism? That’s writing to share information, but when you recall the most esteemed journalists they aren’t the ones who write like a press release. They are those who have perfected their craft, who can shape their words into a compelling picture to evoke emotional reactions in the reader. Isn’t that what you should strive for?”</p>

<p>Yes, of course. Beautiful or effective? You want a lot of both. And unless you’re writing an instruction manual, sometimes prose needs to be beautiful to be effective. I haven’t taken writing seriously in a very long time, so unfortunately my writing now is not much of either, but I suppose now is a fine time to start looking for my best voice again.</p>

<p>I’ll always have a soft spot for Star Wars things, but these paintings by Naci Caba are wonderful. The colors add a great bit of flavor especially to scenes in space that would otherwise be predominantly black and grey.</p>

<div class="aside">In this review, I'll talk about a few parts of the game that stood out to me, and I'll do my best to do so while avoiding spoilers.</div>

<p><em>Detroit: Become Human</em> is a story-heavy adventure game developed by Quantic Dream, the studio I knew best as the creators of <em>Heavy Rain</em>.</p>

<p>The story takes place in a future where androids are commonplace and indistinguishable from humans aside from a computer chip placed on their temple. Predictably, the androids are mistreated and repressed by humans, and you eventually find yourself in the middle of a robot uprising.</p>

<p>You assume the role of three different characters with interweaving narratives, and the actions you take as each character determine the course of the story. The result is a giant web of branching storylines with many different possible outcomes.</p>

            <p>This is a great implementation of an extremely minimal whiteboard app. There is no UI, and you can click to add text or click+drag to add boxes and lines. Zoom options in your browser will change the size, and you can save the HTML if you want to keep a copy.</p>

<p>It’s probably not enough for work meetings, but I thought it was a great, fun product.</p>

            <blockquote>
  <p>Wag was looking to raise $75 million. It went to SoftBank and was like “will you give us $75 million?” SoftBank was like “no haha we’ll give you $300 million,” because that is SoftBank’s whole thing, it loves to give startups vastly more money than they want or need. And so Wag took the money. And then like a year and a half later Wag will get rid of SoftBank by giving back, I don’t know, but I am going to say some number less than $225 million (“well below” the valuation at which it invested). Wag got the $75 million it needed for free.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So under the right circumstances, you can make more money with a flop than you can with a hit!</p>

<p>Wag wasn’t exactly a flop, but SoftBank’s aggressive investment strategy does result in some pretty unusual situations.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.spingle.jp/en/">Spingle</a> is a company based in Hiroshima, Japan that makes hand-crafted leather shoes, and they also have an excellent <a href="https://www.spingle.jp/en/spingle_move/">sneaker lineup</a>. Because the leather molds to your feet over time, the shoes become more comfortable the more you wear them.</p>

<p>They are a little pricey, but they should last a long time and the cost is completely reasonable considering the work that goes into them. And there are plenty of sneakers that cost even more.</p>

            <p><a href="https://aiweirdness.com/post/189170306297/how-to-begin-a-novel">This neural network</a> was trained to output unique opening lines to novels. Some of the results are surprisingly great:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have just been informed, that the debate over the question ‘is it right or wrong to have immortal souls’ has been finally brought to a conclusion.</p>

  <p>When I was a boy, I was fond of the story of the pirate god.</p>

  <p>He had a strange name, and he was a very big boy indeed.</p>

  <p>The village of Pembrokeshire, in the county of Mersey, lies on a wide, happy plain, which, in a few years, was to become known as the “Land of the Endless Mountains.”</p>

  <p>I was playing with my dog, Mark the brown Labrador, and I had forgotten that I was also playing with a dead man.</p>

  <p>How many times have I had the misfortune to die?</p>

  <p>The first day I met my future self, I was aboard the old dirigible that lay in wait for me on the far side of the moon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s hard to call these <em>creative</em> since the AI probably has no concept of what these words actually mean, but there are some really compelling ideas in here.</p>

<p>The last sentence in particular struck me as having so many interesting elements that could be explored more as the story progresses. At the very least, these serve as excellent starting places for ideas that a normal person wouldn’t have on their own.</p>

            <p><a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup">Shape Up</a> is an amazing new web-book by Basecamp that details the process they use to define, build, and ship their products. It has great insights, but I especially appreciated how many of the ideas presented just make a lot of sense. I often nodded along in agreement and recognized concepts that we share in our team. The framework is battle-tested and realistic, and there’s a good chance I’ll be able to integrate some new ideas into our existing workflow without having to reorganize how we think about everything to fit a new metaphor.</p>

<p>Located east of Hiroshima in the Seto Inland Sea, Ōkunoshima (大久野島) is a small island home to over 700 rabbits. The rabbits are wild but friendly, and tourists arrive every day with bags full of food and treats. The island was relatively unknown in Japan until recently when its populality among foreign visitors brought it into the spotlight.</p>
