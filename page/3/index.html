          </header>
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>I first started this personal website just about 20 years ago. It began as a couple of html pages, and spent time as a Wordpress blog, a Tumblr page, and is now a static blog generated by Jekyll. Through that time, it had always just had my name, alexonsager.com. This year, I‚Äôm rebranding it to <strong>Invisible Parade</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="being-online-then">Being online then</h2>

<p>When I started this site I had just entered university, got my first MacBook, and was excited to become a full-fledged citizen of the internet. At the time, I thought it was cool to publish as much of yourself as possible. Tag yourself and your friends in the photos you take, scrobble the music you listen to, check in to the places you go, tweet your thoughts. Since I was broadcasting myself to the world, it made sense to put my name on my website. That‚Äôs how people would know me.</p>

<p>At the same time though, <a href="https://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a> was a cool site with the coolest name. <em>Daring Fireball</em> man, how do you top that?</p>

<p>Envious, I found a site that generates random adjective + noun combinations and hoped for inspiration. The second or third result I got was ‚Äúinvisible parade,‚Äù and I immediately loved the oxymoron. The whole point of a parade is to be seen by all of the people. What then, is the point of an invisible parade?</p>

<p>The name stuck in my head, and I think at one point I may have bought the .net. But I didn‚Äôt have anything to do with it, and eventually let it expire.</p>

<h2 id="being-online-now">Being online now</h2>

<p>It feels less in fashion to use your full name as a brand now. There is the risk of bad attention following you around, but also it‚Äôs just more useful to have a persona. There are literally a gazillion people online, so ‚Äúhey I have a website‚Äù is not enough to make you interesting. You have to let people know people what you‚Äôre about, show some personality.</p>

<p>My real-name domain feels like showing up to a costume party with a name tag that just says ‚ÄúHi, my name is Alex‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt feel fun anymore!</p>

<h2 id="the-rebranding">The rebranding</h2>

<p>On a whim I looked up the invisibleparade domain, and it was available. It felt right, so I nabbed it, and here we are. And it is kind of a perfect name for the site.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm creating this parade of posts, if you will, and I‚Äôm putting in a real effort to make it interesting and nice to look at. But who‚Äôs even looking at it? What is the point of an invisible parade, or an invisible blog?</p>

<p>Well, it‚Äôs fun! I like putting it together. And if anybody happens to stumble across it, I‚Äôll be happy to show it off. So here‚Äôs to another 20 years of parading.</p>

            <p>Following up to my <a href="/2024/12/02/i-want-to-love-mastodon.html">earlier post about the fediverse</a>, I discovered <a href="https://gotosocial.org">GoToSocial</a>. Compared to Mastodon which required a fair amount of server overhead (more than I could justify for just playing around online), GoToSocial is very <a href="https://docs.gotosocial.org/en/latest/getting_started/#server-vps">lightweight</a>: 1 CPU, 1GB memory, and 15GB-20GB of storage space for the first year or so. Sold!</p>

<p>This would let me set up my own single-user server, which solves all of my misgivings about Mastodon.</p>

<div class="callout">
<div class="title">Disclaimer</div>
I am a total novice at all things server-related! I am probably at least a little bit wrong about some of the things I write here.<br />
Please take my experience with a grain of salt, and correct me if you can.
</div>

<p>I have a VPS with <a href="https://coolify.io">Coolify</a> to manage the multiple apps I have running, and all things considered it makes things very easy.<br />
I used a docker-compose file to deploy GoToSocial, and their <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial/main/example/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml">example file</a> was almost perfect as-is.</p>

            <p>For some reason, some sites would not load in Safari. Certain assets, often hosted on a CDN but not always, would hang forever and keep the page from loading. Other browsers worked, curl worked, so it didn‚Äôt seem like a DNS issue. It was driving me crazy.</p>

<p>I think I finally caught the culprit: Adguard‚Äôs network filtering.</p>

<p>Adguard gives you the option to filter all of your internet traffic for various apps on your computer. By default, it does so through a ‚ÄúNetwork Extension‚Äù that registers a local VPN to filter all traffic.</p>

<p>For some reason, this was tripping up just Safari and stopping certain assets from loading. An alternative mode called ‚ÄúAutomatic Proxy‚Äù is available to avoid conflicts with other VPN applications and such, and switching to this mode seems to have fixed the problem for me. Good!</p>

<p>See Adguard‚Äôs documentation <a href="https://adguard.com/kb/adguard-for-mac/features/network/">here</a>.</p>
