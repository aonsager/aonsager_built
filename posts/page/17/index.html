      <p><strong>Amazingly imaginative</strong></p>

<p>This is the story of Oskar Schell, a young boy who is on a quest around New York City, attempting to solve a mystery left in the wake of his father’s death in the 9/11 attacks. The story is told in the form of narratives, letters, and journal entries from the perspective of three individuals, and their interwoven stories are revealed expertly in parallel. The book works as a scrapbook, with the reader discovering elements from the story appearing on the pages, as though they had been pasted in.</p>

<p>The best part of this book is the people you meet, and the stories they tell. Oskar meets a great number of people around the city, and each offers a delightful kernel of his or her life. Alongside these quick glimpses are stories and asides presented by the major characters, not necessarily relevant but always illuminating. Every anecdote is a gem that begs to be savored, and I often found myself setting down the book so I could digest.</p>

<p>This, I believe, is my absolute favorite book. I recommend it to everybody. Written by Jonathan Safran Foer, I believe it to be far superior to <em>Everything is Illuminated</em>.</p>

      <p>Hooray! Along with 18 companies and one other non-profit, <strong>Samasource was chosen to participate in fbFund’s incubator program this summer</strong>. Check out the full list of winners on <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2009/05/28/fbfund-17-companies-and-2-nonprofits-win-head-to-palo-alto/">VentureBeat</a> or <a href="http://www.insidefacebook.com/2009/05/28/facebook-announces-19-2009-fbfund-winners/">InsideFacebook</a>.</p>

<p>What this means is that we’ll have Palo Alto office space, lots of media attention, an official Facebook seal of approval, and possibly free lunches <em>/crossfingers</em>. The catch?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Due to the way fbFund is structured, the non-profit startups cannot receive funding (<a href="http://developers.facebook.com/news.php?blog=1&amp;story=249">Facebook dev blog</a>).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bummer…</p>

<p>Samasource’s Facebook product will allow developers to create work opportunities for underprivileged workers by setting up periodic testing for their active applications. <strong>With Samasource, developers lower costs, reduce poverty, and improve their applications</strong>. Being chosen as a fbFund winner, despite not entailing cash, is extremely significant. Samasource, along with Vittana, the other non-profit winner, is poised to be a frontrunner of social entrepreneurship within the Facebook ecosystem. Being able to work with Facebook officially should greatly increase product quality, market penetration, and overall social impact. Samasource also will provide a valuable service to application developers, so I have high hopes for the success of this project.</p>

<p>Now a quick word about changes within fbFund. Previously the fund awarded grants to the winners, but this year the funding is in the form of an equity investment (more coverage <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2009/04/16/facebooks-fbfund-incubator-program-looks-to-cash-in-on-the-sites-growth/">here</a>). This makes sense, and I think it’s a reasonable change. It does put the non-profits in an awkward spot, but I believe that’s just growing pains. Two non-profits were chosen this year, and that’s a big deal. Optimism tells me that <strong>social entrepreneurship will hold a much more prominent position in the years to come</strong>. Exciting things are happening in the world of social change, and Samasource is fortunate enough to be able to make an impact in a high-visibility environment. We will not disappoint.</p>

        </h1>
      </header>
    <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>Today I ate dinner alone. I think there is nothing wrong with that, but you just don’t see people alone in restaurants all that often (Aren’t you going to be bored? Do you want a magazine or something?). Eating meals, in most cultures everywhere, is regarded as a social activity. I would like to explore why, and have a few hypotheses.</p>

<p><strong>Everybody has to do it</strong>. Three times a day, nearly everybody will eat food at roughly the same time. People share this activity, and so it makes sense for that time to be designated for social interaction. If everybody had tea at 3, or went to the gym at 4, then those would just as strongly be considered a social activity.</p>

<p><strong>We are forced to sit down</strong>. In our busy lives, we are either doing something or are on our way elsewhere to do something. We need to eat though, and eating takes a few minutes, so we take a break and sit down. Meals become social times because they are the only times when social interaction is reliably possible.</p>

<p>For some, the social aspect of meals is essential. I have friends who refuse to spend meals alone, going out of their way to seek a companion or else not eating at all. This may even be the norm. Again, you never see people eating alone at restaurants. Why is this? When did conversation turn from a pleasant circumstance into an essential feature? If hypothesis two is true, then it may be because we depend upon meals for interaction. That doesn’t explain not eating, though. If you are forced to eat dinner alone, the conclusion ought to be, “Oh well, I guess I’ll eat alone today,” and not, “My meal is ruined, so I’ll settle for a quick sandwich.” Conversation is so essential that in its absence we lose all motivation to put effort into a meal. Solitude is preventative of food consumption.</p>

<p>No. That’s not true. Solitude prevents meals, and we resort to mere food consumption. A meal then, ought to be defined as an instance of eating food with others. We have redefined our culinary habits to be inherently social.</p>

<p>Where, then, does that put me? I usually eat meals very quickly, eager to get on with more interesting and productive parts of my life. Conversation is enjoyed, but only in the capacity of my minimal meal time. On the other hand, I enjoy good food and will seize any chance to eat well, even at the cost of doing so alone. It seems I regard meals primarily as food consumption, and enjoy it for gustatory factors. It is probably indicative that I required this posting to realize that meals are inherently social.</p>

<p>But I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that. I am a sociable person who appreciates food. I enjoy conversation at irregular intervals and don’t mind time spent alone. Don’t get me wrong though, I would love to have dinner together. In fact, let’s do it soon.</p>

      <p>I saw a girl at a bus stop who appeared to have a cigarette in her mouth. “Yuck,” I thought. Then, I realized it was a lollipop. I immediately wanted to become her friend.</p>

<p>You see, there is something special about lollipops. As far as your mouth is concerned, you could just as well be eating a normal hard candy. But the stick makes a world’s difference. You are proclaiming to the world, <em>“I am enjoying a candy.”</em> There is no way to be inconspicuous about eating a lollipop. You have committed to this act, and do so with no shame.</p>

<p>And anybody who feels such passion for candy is all right in my book.</p>

      <p>Tuesday, May 5th was Gravity Summit&rsquo;s &ldquo;Social Media Marketing for Business&rdquo; at Stanford. I&rsquo;ve known Rodney Rumford since Joachim and I made Graffiti for Facebook, and he was kind enough to save me a spot.</p>
<p>The focus of the talks was very much aimed towards large businesses; presentations were given by such notable people as Bob Pearson of Dell, Inc. and Charles Miller from DIRECTV. That said, it seemed there were plenty of small business owners attending, and many of the points were generalizable. The main idea is:</p>
<p><b>Social Media is conversation.</b> When a business or individual understands this, they can do great things.</p>
<p>Bob Pearson pointed out that &ldquo;the majority of customers don&rsquo;t call you.&rdquo; Businesses have largely been detached from consumers, interacting only when the customer pursues a purchase. This no longer should be the case, as businesses now have the tools to actively engage in conversation with their customers and meet them halfway.</p>
<p>Social Media brings conversations into the open, and allows businesses to <b>be aware</b> of what people are saying. They then need to actively engage in these conversations and <b>be involved</b> in the dialogue. In doing so, businesses will learn more about the community and share more about themselves. In short, they must learn to <b>be transparent. </b></p>

I don&rsquo;t have the book yet, but the purchase inspired me to pay more attention to writing.
