        </h1>
      </header>
    <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>Today I ate dinner alone. I think there is nothing wrong with that, but you just don’t see people alone in restaurants all that often (Aren’t you going to be bored? Do you want a magazine or something?). Eating meals, in most cultures everywhere, is regarded as a social activity. I would like to explore why, and have a few hypotheses.</p>

<p><strong>Everybody has to do it</strong>. Three times a day, nearly everybody will eat food at roughly the same time. People share this activity, and so it makes sense for that time to be designated for social interaction. If everybody had tea at 3, or went to the gym at 4, then those would just as strongly be considered a social activity.</p>

<p><strong>We are forced to sit down</strong>. In our busy lives, we are either doing something or are on our way elsewhere to do something. We need to eat though, and eating takes a few minutes, so we take a break and sit down. Meals become social times because they are the only times when social interaction is reliably possible.</p>

<p>For some, the social aspect of meals is essential. I have friends who refuse to spend meals alone, going out of their way to seek a companion or else not eating at all. This may even be the norm. Again, you never see people eating alone at restaurants. Why is this? When did conversation turn from a pleasant circumstance into an essential feature? If hypothesis two is true, then it may be because we depend upon meals for interaction. That doesn’t explain not eating, though. If you are forced to eat dinner alone, the conclusion ought to be, “Oh well, I guess I’ll eat alone today,” and not, “My meal is ruined, so I’ll settle for a quick sandwich.” Conversation is so essential that in its absence we lose all motivation to put effort into a meal. Solitude is preventative of food consumption.</p>

<p>No. That’s not true. Solitude prevents meals, and we resort to mere food consumption. A meal then, ought to be defined as an instance of eating food with others. We have redefined our culinary habits to be inherently social.</p>

<p>Where, then, does that put me? I usually eat meals very quickly, eager to get on with more interesting and productive parts of my life. Conversation is enjoyed, but only in the capacity of my minimal meal time. On the other hand, I enjoy good food and will seize any chance to eat well, even at the cost of doing so alone. It seems I regard meals primarily as food consumption, and enjoy it for gustatory factors. It is probably indicative that I required this posting to realize that meals are inherently social.</p>

<p>But I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that. I am a sociable person who appreciates food. I enjoy conversation at irregular intervals and don’t mind time spent alone. Don’t get me wrong though, I would love to have dinner together. In fact, let’s do it soon.</p>

      <p>I saw a girl at a bus stop who appeared to have a cigarette in her mouth. “Yuck,” I thought. Then, I realized it was a lollipop. I immediately wanted to become her friend.</p>

<p>You see, there is something special about lollipops. As far as your mouth is concerned, you could just as well be eating a normal hard candy. But the stick makes a world’s difference. You are proclaiming to the world, <em>“I am enjoying a candy.”</em> There is no way to be inconspicuous about eating a lollipop. You have committed to this act, and do so with no shame.</p>

<p>And anybody who feels such passion for candy is all right in my book.</p>

      <p>Tuesday, May 5th was Gravity Summit&rsquo;s &ldquo;Social Media Marketing for Business&rdquo; at Stanford. I&rsquo;ve known Rodney Rumford since Joachim and I made Graffiti for Facebook, and he was kind enough to save me a spot.</p>
<p>The focus of the talks was very much aimed towards large businesses; presentations were given by such notable people as Bob Pearson of Dell, Inc. and Charles Miller from DIRECTV. That said, it seemed there were plenty of small business owners attending, and many of the points were generalizable. The main idea is:</p>
<p><b>Social Media is conversation.</b> When a business or individual understands this, they can do great things.</p>
<p>Bob Pearson pointed out that &ldquo;the majority of customers don&rsquo;t call you.&rdquo; Businesses have largely been detached from consumers, interacting only when the customer pursues a purchase. This no longer should be the case, as businesses now have the tools to actively engage in conversation with their customers and meet them halfway.</p>
<p>Social Media brings conversations into the open, and allows businesses to <b>be aware</b> of what people are saying. They then need to actively engage in these conversations and <b>be involved</b> in the dialogue. In doing so, businesses will learn more about the community and share more about themselves. In short, they must learn to <b>be transparent. </b></p>

      <p>I just ordered Strunk &amp; White&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Elements of Style,&rdquo; 50th anniversary edition. I don&rsquo;t have the book yet, but the purchase inspired me to pay more attention to writing. Hopefully this can be someplace where I can practice writing, incorporating new ideas and polishing my prose. No high hopes yet, as I don&rsquo;t often continue such things for long, but we&rsquo;ll see how it goes :)</p>

It&rsquo;s done by the guy who made Supersize Me, and chronicles his quest to find Osama Bin Laden. And the trailer plays Gogol Bordello music.</p>
<p> <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/independent/planetbboy/trailer/" target="_blank">Planet B-Boy</a> - A documentary on the breakdancing culture. This movie looks awesome.</p>
<p> <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox_searchlight/youngatheart/trailera/" target="_blank">Young at Heart</a> - A group of elderly people in New England sing covers of great rock songs. This is a must-see.</p>
<p><u><b>The Artsy Type</b></u></p>

<p> <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/independent/thevisitor/trailer/" target="_blank">The Visitor</a> - College professor with a ho-hum life accidentally meets a young couple, and his life gets turned around when as they become friends. This movie looks really good.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/miramax/smartpeople/trailer/" target="_blank">Smart People</a> - The trailer didn&rsquo;t impress me all that much, but I really want this movie to be a good one. I&rsquo;ll keep my fingers crossed.</p>
<p> <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/independent/theyearmyparentswentonvacation/trailer/" target="_blank">O Ano em que Meus Pais Saíram De Férias</a> - A Brazilian boy is taken in by his Jewish grandfather&rsquo;s neighbor (?) when his parents are exiled.

<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/independent/backseat/trailer/" target="_blank">Backseat</a> - Two guys go on a roadtrip to get away from life and have wild antics along the way. This movie will probably either be really good or pretty dumb, so I hope for the former. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount_vantage/sonoframbow/trailer/" target="_blank">Son of Rambow</a> - A movie about two boys filming a movie. It wowed the crowds at Sundance, and I think &ldquo;delightful&rdquo; would be a good word to describe it. They asked us to help promote the movie through Graffiti, and I wish we could&rsquo;ve :(. </p>
<p><b> </b><u><b>The Exciting Type</b></u><b> </b></p>
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/independent/romandegare/trailerb/" target="_blank">Roman De Gare</a> - Follows the stories of three people, who may not be exactly who they claim to be. I&rsquo;m not sure if this is going to be a thriller, but it seems pretty exciting, and clever. I&rsquo;m excited to see Dominique Pinon.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/magnolia/flawless/trailer/" target="_blank">Flawless</a> - I love bank robbery movies! This one stars an unlikely duo trying to pull an inside job. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/independent/spiral/trailer/" target="_blank">Spiral</a> - I personally will not be watching this, but if you&rsquo;re into creepy, disturbing horror movies then this one&rsquo;s for you.</p>
<p><u><b>The Funny Type</b></u></p>
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/independent/priceless/trailer/" target="_blank">Priceless</a> - Huzzah! Another rockstar French cast. It&rsquo;s a remake of Breakfast at Tiffany&rsquo;s, and it looks like it won&rsquo;t disappoint. That, and I love Audrey Tautou.</p>
<p> <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/universal/forgettingsarahmarshall/large.html" target="_blank">Forgetting Sarah Marshall</a> - 40 Year Old Virgin? Knocked Up? Superbad? Yeah, their new one is coming out. Go watch it. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony_pictures/youdontmesswiththezohan/high.html" target="_blank">You Don&rsquo;t Mess with the Zohan</a> - I haven&rsquo;t been excited for an Adam Sandler movie in a while, but this one sure does look fun.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/newline/bekindrewind/large.html" target="_blank">Be Kind Rewind</a> - A movie about Jack Black making movies? Heck yes! </p>
