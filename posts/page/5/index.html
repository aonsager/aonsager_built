          <a href="/posts/rebranding-the-site-invisible-parade">Rebranding the site: Invisible Parade</a>
        </h1>
      </header>
    <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>I first started this personal website just about 20 years ago. It began as a couple of html pages, and spent time as a Wordpress blog, a Tumblr page, and is now a static blog generated by Jekyll. Through that time, it had always just had my name, alexonsager.com. This year, I’m rebranding it to <strong>Invisible Parade</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="being-online-then">Being online then</h2>

<p>When I started this site I had just entered university, got my first MacBook, and was excited to become a full-fledged citizen of the internet. At the time, I thought it was cool to publish as much of yourself as possible. Tag yourself and your friends in the photos you take, scrobble the music you listen to, check in to the places you go, tweet your thoughts. Since I was broadcasting myself to the world, it made sense to put my name on my website. That’s how people would know me.</p>

<p>At the same time though, <a href="https://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a> was a cool site with the coolest name. <em>Daring Fireball</em> man, how do you top that?</p>

<p>Envious, I found a site that generates random adjective + noun combinations and hoped for inspiration. The second or third result I got was “invisible parade,” and I immediately loved the oxymoron. The whole point of a parade is to be seen by all of the people. What then, is the point of an invisible parade?</p>

<p>The name stuck in my head, and I think at one point I may have bought the .net. But I didn’t have anything to do with it, and eventually let it expire.</p>

<h2 id="being-online-now">Being online now</h2>

<p>It feels less in fashion to use your full name as a brand now. There is the risk of bad attention following you around, but also it’s just more useful to have a persona. There are literally a gazillion people online, so “hey I have a website” is not enough to make you interesting. You have to let people know people what you’re about, show some personality.</p>

<p>My real-name domain feels like showing up to a costume party with a name tag that just says “Hi, my name is Alex”. It doesn’t feel fun anymore!</p>

<h2 id="the-rebranding">The rebranding</h2>

<p>On a whim I looked up the invisibleparade domain, and it was available. It felt right, so I nabbed it, and here we are. And it is kind of a perfect name for the site.</p>

<p>I’m creating this parade of posts, if you will, and I’m putting in a real effort to make it interesting and nice to look at. But who’s even looking at it? What is the point of an invisible parade, or an invisible blog?</p>

<p>Well, it’s fun! I like putting it together. And if anybody happens to stumble across it, I’ll be happy to show it off. So here’s to another 20 years of parading.</p>

    <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>Following up to my <a href="/2024/12/02/i-want-to-love-mastodon.html">earlier post about the fediverse</a>, I discovered <a href="https://gotosocial.org">GoToSocial</a>. Compared to Mastodon which required a fair amount of server overhead (more than I could justify for just playing around online), GoToSocial is very <a href="https://docs.gotosocial.org/en/latest/getting_started/#server-vps">lightweight</a>: 1 CPU, 1GB memory, and 15GB-20GB of storage space for the first year or so. Sold!</p>

<p>This would let me set up my own single-user server, which solves all of my misgivings about Mastodon.</p>

<div class="callout">
<div class="title">Disclaimer:</div>
I am a total novice at all things server-related! I am probably at least a little bit wrong about some of the things I write here. Please take my experience with a grain of salt, and correct me if you can.
</div>

<p>I have a VPS with <a href="https://coolify.io">Coolify</a> to manage the multiple apps I have running, and all things considered it makes things very easy.<br />
I used a docker-compose file to deploy GoToSocial, and their <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial/main/example/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml">example file</a> was almost perfect as-is.</p>

<h2 id="port-settings">Port settings</h2>

<p>Coolify acts as a reverse proxy, so I used that part of the configuration:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">services</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="na">gotosocial</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="s">...</span>
    <span class="s">ports</span><span class="err">:</span>
      <span class="c1"># - "443:8080"</span>
      <span class="c1">## For letsencrypt:</span>
      <span class="c1">#- "80:80"</span>
      <span class="c1">## For reverse proxy setups:</span>
      <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">127.0.0.1:8002:8080"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>8002 was just an open port that I chose, and Coolify is smart enough to use that port to route traffic from my GoToSocial domain.</p>

<h2 id="file-permissions">File permissions</h2>

<p><a href="https://rknight.me/blog/installing-gotosocial-on-coolify/">Robb Knight’s blog post</a> showed me how to fix the sqlite database being unable to load because of a permissions issue. I had a similar issue with the Wazero compilation cache directory not being created, but I ended up just commenting that line out because it works without.</p>

<h2 id="shooting-myself-in-the-foot">Shooting myself in the foot</h2>

<p>I knew I had to mount a volume to make the database persist across redeploys and not be wiped fresh every time. <a href="https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/persistent-storage">Coolify’s documentation</a> made it very clear,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The base directory inside the container is /app.
So if you need to store your files under storage directory, you need to define /app/storage as the destination path.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, I changed the settings to make sure that things were stored under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/app</code></p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">services</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="na">gotosocial</span><span class="pi">:</span>
    <span class="s">...</span>
    <span class="s">environment</span><span class="err">:</span>
      <span class="s">...</span>
      <span class="s">GTS_DB_ADDRESS</span><span class="err">:</span> <span class="s">/app/storage/sqlite.db</span>
    <span class="s">volumes</span><span class="err">:</span>
      <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">~/gotosocial/data:/app/storage</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Which worked, except!<br />
I hadn’t realized that media storage also defaulted to the same (first) <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/gotosocial/storage</code> directory. Since this directory was no longer being bound, it was wiped clean after every redeploy.
Remote media was fine because it could be fetched again, but images I uploaded were lost.</p>

<p>I poked around in the terminal and saw that both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/app/storage</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/gotosocial/storage</code> were being created and used with no issues, so I just switched the database address back to the default <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/gotosocial/storage</code>… and everything worked as expected.</p>

<p>So, I don’t quite understand what the Coolify docs were trying to tell me.</p>

<h2 id="end">End</h2>

<p>Things seem to be working fine now, and I’m using mostly <a href="http://semaphore.social">Semaphore</a> to interact with the instance.<br />
You can follow me <a href="https://gts.invisibleparade.com/@alex">here!</a></p>

    <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>For some reason, some sites would not load in Safari. Certain assets, often hosted on a CDN but not always, would hang forever and keep the page from loading. Other browsers worked, curl worked, so it didn’t seem like a DNS issue. It was driving me crazy.</p>

<p>I think I finally caught the culprit: Adguard’s network filtering.</p>

<p>Adguard gives you the option to filter all of your internet traffic for various apps on your computer. By default, it does so through a “Network Extension” that registers a local VPN to filter all traffic.</p>

<p>For some reason, this was tripping up just Safari and stopping certain assets from loading. An alternative mode called “Automatic Proxy” is available to avoid conflicts with other VPN applications and such, and switching to this mode seems to have fixed the problem for me. Good!</p>

<p>See Adguard’s documentation <a href="https://adguard.com/kb/adguard-for-mac/features/network/">here</a>.</p>
