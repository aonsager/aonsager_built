        </h1>
      </header>
    <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>Just using iCloud sync has been pretty solid in my experience. I have two Macs and one iPhone that share a single vault, and I’ve had no major issues… except for one.</p>

<p>Because the entire Obsidian folder lives inside of iCloud, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.obsidian</code> settings folder is also synced. Usually a good thing, except that the multi-pane view I have setup for desktop keeps getting pushed onto mobile. Because the panes all become tiny, and because Obsidian reverts to this view every time I use the app on desktop again, Obsidian basically became unusable on my phone.</p>

<h2 id="the-solution">The solution</h2>

<p>The strategy is to force the desktop and mobile versions to use different config files. I can create a desktop-specific config folder and tell my two desktops to look at that one instead of the default.</p>

<p>In <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Preferences &gt; About</code> there is an option to “Override config folder” and specify a different folder location. It seems that this setting is set locally and isn’t synced along with the rest of the data.</p>

<p>First I created a copy of the existing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.obsidian</code> config folder to somewhere else on my computer.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cp</span> /<span class="o">{</span>Vault location<span class="o">}</span>/.obsidian ~/Documents/.obsidian_desktop
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, I create a symlink to that new config folder within my Obsidian vault. This will exist on the mobile vault too, but should just be ignored</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">ln</span> <span class="nt">-s</span> ~/Documents/.obsidian_desktop /<span class="o">{</span>Vault location<span class="o">}</span>/.obsidian_desktop
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, within the Obsidian desktop app I override the config folder and set it to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.obsidian_desktop</code></p>

<p>Because I created  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.obsidian_desktop</code> inside my Documents folder, which is synced to iCloud, my second desktop will get the folder automatically. I just need to change the settings within the Obsidian desktop app there too, to get it to start looking at the new config.</p>

<p>There is nothing to do for the mobile app, and now the desktop and mobile versions will be looking at different configs so layouts will remain independent.</p>

<p>The only thing I have to be careful of is that adding plugins and changing settings will not transfer between desktop and mobile, so I will need to make changes to both manually. This probably won’t be annoying for me because I have things mostly setup the way I like them now, but is something to keep in mind.</p>

      <p>The elevator in our office building has a small LCD panel that shows information like the current floor, but when the total weight of passengers crosses a certain threshold it also adds a short note: “Sorry the elevator is crowded”.</p>

<p>It struck me – of all possible features for an elevator display, how did they decide that they needed this one? It has no impact on the elevator’s function of moving people vertically. And a crowded elevator is not the elevator’s fault (although this is most likely just an example of Japan’s self-deprecating approach to hospitality). So why was this message deemed necessary?</p>

<p>The answer, of course, is that when designing an elevator your customer is not the people riding the elevator. It’s the people <em>buying</em> the elevator, such as the owners of an office building. When they compare your elevator to competitors, “Ours will make your building more pleasant to visit” must be a key selling point.</p>

<p>This was a little reminder for me that it’s crucial to identify your true customer because it will have an enormous effect on your product’s direction.</p>

      <p>I tend to procrastinate if I let myself, so I’ve tried my share of techniques to keep it in check. At some point, I read that a fear of failure can cause procrastination, and this really resonated with me. Realizing this has helped me understand where my urge to put things off is coming from.</p>

<p>If I have a large task in front of me, my mind rushes through everything that needs to be done and affirms how difficult it will be. I imagine (mostly subconsciously) all the ways that my output will be less than ideal, and that is what keeps me from taking action.</p>

<p>So as a quick mental technique, I recognize that this fear of failure is acting as a roadblock and tell myself that I’ll just bang out a first effort that will definitely be of poor quality. I know it will be bad, and that will be OK. Polishing that will be a task left for future me.</p>

<p>In reality, it won’t be perfect, but neither will it be terrible. Polishing it into something that I can be proud of will not be as hard as it seems now, especially once I have a first draft to work with.</p>

      <p>I’ve had an idea for a fun art project in my head for many years now, and I don’t see myself going through with it any time soon, so I’ll compromise by just writing about it.</p>

<p>The idea is to photograph people (with permission) who are wearing headphones in the city. Their photo will be shown along with the song they happened to be listening to. It would be interesting to see if a viewer would see any correlation between a person’s visual appearance and their taste in music. The prompt “What song was playing right now” is much more interesting than “What is your favorite music,” and some people might think that I caught them at just the wrong time, making things more fun for me.</p>

<p>Since the subjects will generally be preoccupied, I imagine I’d design a small pamphlet that quickly describes the project and hand that out to people who don’t look too busy.</p>

<p>Maybe one day.</p>
